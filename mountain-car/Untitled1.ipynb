    "The car is under-powered so the agent needs to learn to rock back and forth to get enough momentum to reach the goal. At each time step the agent receives from the environment its current velocity (a float between -0.07 and 0.07), and it's current position (a float between -1.2 and 0.5). Because our state is continuous there are a potentially infinite number of states that our agent could be in. We need a function approximation method to help the agent deal with this. In this notebook we will use tile coding. We provide a tile coding implementation for you to use, imported above with tiles3."
